beachscen:While the two of you are relaxing and soaking up the sun rays, a volley ball hits you in the face. The group who was playing seems apologetic. What do you do?
beachscenop1:1. Accept their apology and toss the ball back to them.
beachscenop2:2. Tell them to go screw themselves and toss the ball into the water.
beachgoodresult:Aiko couldn't stop laughing after you throw the ball and the group has to swim out to get it back. She's got quite a mean streak in her. The two of you swim in the ocean a bit and have a good time.
beachbadresult:Now that they know they can get away with it, that group keeps 'accidentally' hitting their ball towards you. At one point it knocked over Aiko's soda bottle and stained her bag!

gardenscen:As you're walking through the garden with your date, a butterfly lands right on your nose. Suddenly, you feel like you really have to sneeze... What do you do?
gardenscenop1:1. Try not to sneeze
gardenscenop2:2. Just sneeze
gardengoodresult:You decide to just sneeze. As you take a deep breath, the tickle in your nose suddenly vanishes. Kyu enjoys interacting with the butterfly while it sites on your face. Apparently, fairies and butterflies can understand each other.
gardenbadresult:You try to hold in your sneeze, but just can't. You scare away the butterfly and get snot all over Kyu!
